         stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
        It the standard markup language used for
          creating and structuring web pages and 
          web applications. HTML provides a way to 
          define the structure of content on a 
          webpage using a set of elements or tags.
           These elements are used to define 
           headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
            images, tables, forms, and other
             components of a webpage.,HTML documents 
             are composed of elements, which are 
             enclosed in tags. Tags typically come in 
             pairs, an opening tag and a closing tag, 
             though some tags are self-closing.
              For example, to create a paragraph in 
              HTML, you would use the <p> tag for the 
                opening paragraph tag and </p> for the 
                closing paragraph tag. Here's
                 an example: </p>

<b>definitoin</b><p> .<img src="./images.html/css.jfif" alt="">CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to
     describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, 
     MathML, etc.). CSS describes how elements
      should be rendered on screen, on paper,
       in speech, or on other media.</p>

    CSS allows web developers to control the layout, appearance, and formatting of multiple web 
    pages all at once by separating the structure of a document from its presentation.
     This separation enhances the flexibility and maintainability of web pages.</p><hr>

                <img src="./images.html/jawa scriot.png" alt="">it seems like you might be referring to JavaScript, not "jawa script." JavaScript 
                is a high-level programming language commonly used in web development to create 
                interactive and dynamic
                 elements within web pages.</p>
